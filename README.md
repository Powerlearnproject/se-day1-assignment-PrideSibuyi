Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a process of building code that solves real world problems, in the technology industry it helps develop solutions to problems one cannot solve by self.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of software engineering (1968 NATO Conference)
The term software engineering was first coined at the 1968 NATO software enginerring conference held in Garmisch, Germany.

2. The Agile Manifesto (2001)

In 2001, a group of software developers published the agile manifesto, which emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration and iterative development.

3. The advent of object-Oriented programming (1980s)

The 1980s saw the rise of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Smalltalk, C++, and Java.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis

This phase involves collecting and analyzing the requirements from stake holders to understand what the software needs to achieve.

2. System Design

Based on the requiremnts, the system design phase outlones the architecture and components of the softwaree

3. Impementation 

This phase involves the actual writing of code based on the design specifications

4. Testing

The testing phase ensures that the software meets the specified requirements

5. Deployment 

The deployment phase involves releasing the software to the  end-user.

6. Maintenance

After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology 

Advantages 
Clear Structure
Well-Defined Milestones
Documentation

Disadvantages
Inflexibility
Late testing
Risk of misalignment

Appropriate Scenarios
	• Stable Requirements: Projects with well-defined and stable requirements, such as regulatory compliance software.
	• Small Projects: Smaller projects with limited scope and complexity.
	• Predictable Outcomes: Projects where the outcome is predictable and the technology is well-understood.
Agile Methodology

Advantages
Flexibility
Early and continuous testing
Customer satisfaction

Disadvantages
Requires active involvement 
Less Predictable
Documentation

Appropriate Scenarios

Dynamic Requirements
Complex Projects 
Customer-Centric projects


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer

Coding and Implementation: Write, test, and maintain code for software applications based on design specifications.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

Test Planning: Develop test plans and test cases based on software requirements and design specifications.

Project Manager

Project Planning: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables in collaboration with stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs Enhances coding efficiency 
VCS - Ensures collaboration and code integrity

IDE The likes of Visual studio

VCS The likes Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common challenges: changing requirements, tight deadlines, technical debt, communication gaps.

Strategies: Agile methods, clear communication, continuous integration, and regular refactoring.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components.

Integration Testing: Checks interactions between modules.

System Testing: Validates entire system functionality.

Acceptance Testing: Ensures user requirements are met.

Importance: Ensures reliability, functionality, and user satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering: Crafting inputs to guide AI model outputs effectively.

Importance: Enhances accuracy, relevance, and efficiency in AI interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."

Improved Prompt: "Summarize the causes and effects of World War II in 100 words."

Why: Specificity ensures focused, relevant, and concise AI responses.
